# django-model-rag

Discover and normalize text content from any Django model, ready for a RAG
pipeline.

**It is** a registry and a set of extractors that turn instances of your
Django models into plain-text `NormalizedDocument`s — with a title, a
language, a stable source key and a resolved URL — so that a retrieval
pipeline can index them and cite real pages.

**It is not** a RAG pipeline. It does not chunk, embed, store vectors or call
an LLM. That is the job of a separate package,
[django-minimal-rag](https://github.com/gtolivier/django-minimal-rag), which
does not depend on this one.

## Status

Pre-alpha, not usable yet. The package is being written test-first, using
an earlier prototype as its behavioral specification. See the
[roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for what is done and the order of the features.

## Registering a model

```python
from django_model_rag import SyncPipeline, rag

rag.register(Product, fields=["name", "description"], title_field="name")
rag.register(Article)  # fields guessed
rag.register(Note, exclude=["internal_remarks"])

documents = SyncPipeline().run()
```

Without `fields`, the text fields are guessed at registration, from their
type alone:

- **What is guessed:** a field whose type is exactly `CharField`, or a
  `TextField` or one of its subclasses. A `CharField` subclass is not
  guessed — `SlugField`, `EmailField`, `URLField`, and your own or a
  third-party package's subclasses too (translated fields, for instance).
  Name such a field in `fields=` to extract it.
- **In which order:** `title`, `name`, `heading` and `label` come first, in
  that order, then the other fields in declaration order. The first one
  gives the document title, unless `title_field` names another field.
- **Nothing is left out by name.** A text field holding a password hash, a
  token or private notes is guessed like any other. Leave it out with
  `exclude=`, or declare `fields=` instead.

`exclude` removes fields from the guessed ones and from nothing else: it
cannot add a field that is not guessed, and it cannot be combined with
`fields`. This differs from a `ModelForm`, whose `exclude` removes fields
from all its editable fields; both start from an implicit set, and here
that set is the guessed text fields. A model with nothing to guess, or whose
`exclude` leaves nothing, fails at registration with `ImproperlyConfigured`.
